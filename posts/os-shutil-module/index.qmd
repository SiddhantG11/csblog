# os module 

I find directories and navigating files confusing. The `os` module can help with that. 

- `os.getcwd()` : prints the current directory. 
- `os.chdir()` : changes current working directory  
- `os.mkdir()` : creates directory 
  - use `os.makedirs()` if sub directories are needed
    -Use `os.removedirs()` to remove 
- `os.rename("old file name","new file name")`

> it's generally not a good idea to use `removedirs` since you can delete folders you don't want to on accident 





# shutil 

Super useful module for file/directory operations

- `shutil.move("source","destination")` moves file from source path to destination 
- `shutil.copy("source","destination")` : copies file from source to destination 
- `os.copytree("source","destination")` : copies folder and all sub folders to destination
