The `df.query` method in pandas is used to filter a dataframe based on a boolean critera. 

This means you can use operators like: `==,!=,>,< >=,<=,and,or,not` inside the query as a string! 

Here's how it works 

```{python}
import pandas as pd
# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```
If you want to filter the data by one city (for example Houston). You do create a filter for that like this: 

```{python}
Houston = df[df['City']=='Houston']
print(Houston)
```
But if you use the `query` method you can create a filter much faster like this 

```{python}
Houston = df.query("City == 'Houston'")
print(Houston)
```

You can refer to variables in the environment using the `@` symbol 

```{python}
target_city = 'Houston'
df_city = df.query("City == @target_city")
print(df_city)
```
